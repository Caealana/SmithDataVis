Smith Energy Consumption Data Visualization:
-Utilizes the Smith College energy consumption data from buildingOS.com

Goal: Aimed towards users from the Smith College student body. To allow users to compare energy consumption between different house/dorm buildings on campus. Allow users to interact with 
and see how small differences in lifestyle(taking a shorter shower/leaving the lights off for a little longer) impact the energy consumption
of their house.

Working Features:
Dropdown Menu: Allows user to chose energy type to display. Available energy types are taken from the data file.
Checkboxes: Allows users to select which dorm buildings to view energy consumption for. Users can select multiple buildings at once.
Slider Bars: Users can adjust the number of people who undertake the change to their habits + adjust the number of minutes subtracted
from each person's shower/number of minutes each person leaves the light off longer.
